# Canyon Bomber
A [GodotEngine 3](https://godotengine.org/) tutorial to recreate Canyon Bomber

I want to begin developing a series of tutorials for Godot 3, both as a way of helping myself continue to learn, but also as a way to contribute and expand on the number of tutorials available. In this series I'll be looking back at some classic video games and attempting to recreate them in Godot.

The obvious starting point to a series like this is always Pong or Breakout, but as Godot comes with a pretty good [Pong example](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/2d/pong) and I've done far to many Breakout examples in various languages and game engines over the years I wanted to branch out and try somtehing different. So for this example we'll be trying to clone Canyon Bomber

## What is Canyon Bomber?

Canyon Bomber is a 1 or 2 player arcade designed and developed by [Howard Delman](http://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/howard_delman/interview_howard_delman.html) and released in 1977 by Atari. Amazingly the game fit on one 2048 byte chip thanks to its use of 2 colors and colorized cabinet overlay to give the appearance of more colors.

The goal in Canyon Bomber is to destroy the most rocks in the canyon to outscore your opponent, be it another player in 2 player mode, or the cpu in single player mode. Part of the reason I selected this game for the first tutorial is its simplified control scheme. Each player has a single bomb button to control when a bomb is released. The player does not have direct control of the movement of their vehicle.
